🚀 Resume Category Predictor – AI Powered Web App

🔗 Live App: https://your-app-name.streamlit.app

An end-to-end Machine Learning web application that predicts the most relevant job category from a resume (PDF or text input) using Natural Language Processing and a trained classification model.

This project demonstrates the complete ML lifecycle: data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, serialization, and cloud deployment using Streamlit.

📌 About The Project

Recruiters and HR teams receive hundreds of resumes daily. This application automates resume classification by analyzing content and predicting the most suitable job category with confidence scores.

The system uses TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression to perform text-based classification.
